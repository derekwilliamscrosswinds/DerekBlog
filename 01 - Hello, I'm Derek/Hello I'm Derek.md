# Hello, I am Derek

Ok, enough with telling you who I am...ok just kidding. I am Derek Williams. I am a DevOps problem solver. Not an expert? Absolutely not. The world of technology is in such a constant state of flux that I am uber skeptical of any person that calls themselves an expert at anything in technology. However, as to not under sell myself I have an immense amount of actionable knowledge...and that right there is the **key**.  

There are so many smart individuals out on the technology world that are simply brilliant technologists. There are many brilliant engineers, consultants, and communicators that it is almost impossible not to bump into someone that doesn't have some technology factoid just ready to be unleashed. The frustrating part of all these brilliant individuals is this, *How many of these people have actionable knowledge?*  

This is a normal part of interacting with any technologist. Often times the technologist knows the lingo, can quote the white papers,  can drop a few buzz words and suddenly you are sucked into their world, suddenly you are captivated by their salespitch. The true test always comes though, is their knowledge actionable? Can they help solve **MY** problems; the problems specific to **MY** business? Sometimes, they absolutely can. It is my experience, the actionable knowledge is often lacking.  

That is why I hope to solve with this Blog. PRovide actionable advice that can positively impact your business's productivity. Provide guideance and visibility into an industry than can easily leave the less informed behind. Much of this blog will likely contain analysis of new cloud technologies, how cloud impacts your business operations and profitability (or lack there of). My mission is to demystify as much as possible through commentary, tutorials, and case studies.
